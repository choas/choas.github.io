> Reason, also known as ReasonML, \[â€¦\] offers a syntax familiar to JavaScript programmers, and transpiles to OCaml. â€” [Wikipedia:Â Reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason_(syntax_extension_for_OCaml))

On heise there is a series of (German) articles about ReasonML by [Marco Emrich](https://twitter.com/marcoemrich): [Funktional im Web unterwegs mit ReasonML](https://www.heise.de/hintergrund/Funktional-im-Web-unterwegs-mit-ReasonML-Teil-1-JavaScript-trifft-OCaml-4701765.html). By the way, ML does not stand for Machine Learning, it has to do with the fact that ReasonML is based on [OCaml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCaml). OCaml is based on [Standard ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ML), a functional programming language from 1983. I think, if OCaml were a product and not a research project, it would probably be renamed 'ocaML' ðŸ˜œ. OCaml was also the basis for [F\#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_Sharp_(programming_language)) from Microsoft.

OCaml and JavaScript have functional and object-oriented aspects, which simplifies the syntax adaptation. But ReasonML is not the only functional programming language for JavaScript. There are already [Elm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elm_(programming_language)) and [PureScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PureScript). But PureScript uses the [Haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)) syntax. The learning curve of Haskel is relatively high and then there is the thing with the [monads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)) ðŸ™€. For this reason, ReasonML should be easier to learn.

## ReasonML Example

ReasonML uses [BuckleScript](https://bucklescript.github.io/) for compilation:

```shell
npm install -g bs-platform
```

Below is the code from the heise article that uses the idea of the [stringCalc Kata](https://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1). The definitions are described in the heise article (in German).

```reasonml
let splitByComma = str
  => str |> Js.String.split(",") |> Array.to_list;

let mapToInt = List.map(int_of_string);

let lessThan1000 = List.filter(x => x <= 1000);

let sum = List.fold_left((+), 0);

let stringCalc = str => str
  |> splitByComma
  |> mapToInt
  |> lessThan1000
  |> sum;

stringCalc("1,2005,3") |> Js.log
```

Bucklescript can create an own project. But you can also convert the ReasonML code to JavaScript as follows:

```shell
bsc stringcalc.re > stringcalc.js
```

â€¦ and this generates the following JavaScript Code:

```js
// Generated by BUCKLESCRIPT, PLEASE EDIT WITH CARE
'use strict';

var List = require("bs-platform/lib/js/list.js");
var $$Array = require("bs-platform/lib/js/array.js");
var Caml_format = require("bs-platform/lib/js/caml_format.js");

function splitByComma(str) {
  return $$Array.to_list(str.split(","));
}

function mapToInt(param) {
  return List.map(Caml_format.caml_int_of_string, param);
}

var lessThan1000 = List.filter((function (x) {
        return x <= 1000;
      }));

function sum(param) {
  return List.fold_left((function (prim, prim$1) {
                return prim + prim$1 | 0;
              }), 0, param);
}

function stringCalc(str) {
  var param = $$Array.to_list(str.split(","));
  return sum(lessThan1000(List.map(Caml_format.caml_int_of_string, param)));
}

console.log(stringCalc("1,2005,3"));

exports.splitByComma = splitByComma;
exports.mapToInt = mapToInt;
exports.lessThan1000 = lessThan1000;
exports.sum = sum;
exports.stringCalc = stringCalc;
/* lessThan1000 Not a pure module */
```

When executed with `node stringcalc.js` a 4 is shown, because 2005 is greater than 1000.

## ReasonML Buch

There is a book by Axel Rauschmayer: [Exploring ReasonML and functional programming](http://reasonmlhub.com/exploring-reasonml/). Without having read the book, I can say that it must be excellent, because I met Axel at [Beyond Tellerand 2018](https://beyondtellerrand.com/) and he told me about ReasonML with great enthusiasm. This enthusiasm is definitely reflected in the book.

Some blog posts from [Axel Rauschmayer](https://twitter.com/rauschma) about ReasonML:

- [JavaScript vs. TypeScript vs. ReasonML](https://2ality.com/2018/03/javascript-typescript-reasonml.html)
  - [Making a cross-platform mobile game in Reason/OCaml](https://jaredforsyth.com/posts/making-a-cross-platform-mobile-game-in-reason-ocaml/)
- [What is ReasonML?](https://2ality.com/2017/11/about-reasonml.html) â€¦ and [more](https://2ality.com/archive.html#tags=reasonml)

## Summary

I like the functional approach of ReasonML and I should definitely develop something with it.
