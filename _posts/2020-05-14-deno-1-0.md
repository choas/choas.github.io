> Deno is a runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that is based on the V8 JavaScript engine and the Rust programming language. It was created by Ryan Dahl, original creator of Node.js, and is focused on productivity. â€” [Wikipedia: Deno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deno_(software))

The [36th Munich Node.js User Group Meetup (First virtual meetup)](https://www.meetup.com/Munich-Node-js-User-Group/events/269878119/) was last month and [Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno) ðŸ¦• was also mentioned. Today version [1.0](https://deno.land/v1) has been released.

I wrote a docker file and pushed it also to docker hub:

```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:20.04

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    curl unzip \
    && apt-get clean -y \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

RUN curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh

RUN mkdir /deno
VOLUME [ "/deno" ]
WORKDIR /done

EXPOSE 8080

ENTRYPOINT [ "/root/.deno/bin/deno" ]
```

Build the docker file as follows:

```bash
docker build -t choas/deno .
```

Here are a few ways to run Deno and [here are more](https://deno.land/std/examples/):

```bash
docker run choas/deno --version
```

```bash
docker run -it -v $PWD:/deno choas/deno run hello.ts
```

```bash
docker run choas/deno eval "console.log(6*7)"
```

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 choas/deno run --allow-net --allow-read https://deno.land/std/examples/chat/server.ts
```

You can find the Dockerfile on [GitHub choas/deno-docker](https://github.com/choas/deno-docker) and the Docker image on [docker hub choas/deno](https://hub.docker.com/r/choas/deno).

## Summary

The Docker image is a good start, if you would like to try Deno. But you can also [install](https://github.com/denoland/deno_install) it locally. The next step is the [manual](https://deno.land/manual) or [Whatâ€™s Deno, and how is it different from Node.js?](https://blog.logrocket.com/what-is-deno/)

Will it be a _bye bye Node.js_?
