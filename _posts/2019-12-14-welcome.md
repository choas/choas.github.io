Welcome to my new blog. The old one (blog.choas.net) doesn't exist anymore and was really old. It was a self-written blog software with semantic aspects, where a word could have some meta information like name, description, URL, tags and some links to other words.

With this blog here I will stay _normal_. By the way, in 5 years someone will look at this blog post and find out that there were a few more blog posts and that's it - until I come up another one ... blog post lifecycle ðŸ˜„

## What's about

This blog is about interesting things I find on the internet and I think it's worth writing some sentences. These could be something about programming, machine learning and other buzzwords. Maybe also about SAP Leonardo, where Iâ€™ve written a book [Machine Learning mit SAP Leonardo][leonardo-buch] and created the [sap-leonardo npm package][leonardo-npm]. For job related stuff I write [here][cxlabs].

## Jekyll

I use [Jekyll] which "transform your plain text into static websites and blogs". I donâ€™t need a dynamic system. I need something where I can write some text and then _transform_ it. This allows me to use e.g. [Ulysses] at public transport to write something. Github also supports Jekyll on their [GitHub Pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/).
Jekyll allows the integration of third-party comment systems, but why should I hope for one useful comment between all those spam comments? If you want to reach me, just write me on [Twitter][tw-choas] (DM is open at the moment).
