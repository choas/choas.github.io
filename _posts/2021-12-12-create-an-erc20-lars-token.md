excerpt: Starting with a small web3 nodejs example and ending up with an ERC20 LARS token.

> The ERC-20 introduces a standard for Fungible Tokens, in other words, they have a property that makes each Token be exactly the same (in type and value) of another Token. For example, an ERC-20 Token acts just like the ETH, meaning that 1 Token is and will always be equal to all the other Tokens. â€” [ERC-20 TOKEN STANDARD](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/)

I searched for a small 'web3 nodejs' example, because for metaverse and [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/) you use [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) to log in and synchronize. Everything is based on [Web 3.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3). And then I ended up creating an ERC20 token.

I found a simple example, forked it and updated the packages: [web3-nodejs](https://github.com/choas/web3-nodejs). Itâ€™s always fantastic,NOT ðŸ¤” to see all those _deprecated_ and _no longer supported_ warnings during the installation of Ethereum Node.js packages.  Are people really using those libraries in production?

I installed and started [ganache-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ganache-cli). Run the example and got a result.

Finished?

Yes, if I didnâ€™t have connected the Metamask wallet to my local test-net. Iâ€™ve tried to swap some of my test ETHs to BAT ([Basic Attention Token](https://basicattentiontoken.org/)) token, which of course didnâ€™t work.

But what about a token on my test-net? I found this Youtube [How to create an ERC20 Token with Ganache CLI - by Mike Stay @ Pyrofex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYlRUlSR4k) video.

## How-to create an ERC20 LARS Token

First download this video and watch it:

```shell
youtube-dl UgYlRUlSR4k
```

Then, if you didnâ€™t have installed the ganache-cli do it und run it:

```shell
npm install -g ganache-cli
ganache-cli
```

This starts a local Ethereum network and creates ten accounts and each has 100 ETH. Donâ€™t jump around like crazy, this isnâ€™t real Ether, but the cool thing is: you donâ€™t have to pay real [Ethereum Gas](https://ethereumprice.org/gas/) :)

### Code

Open the [Remix Ethereum IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) and create a `MyToken.sol` file under the contracts folder (which I found [here](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/simple-erc20-token-example/4403)):

```javascript
// contracts/SimpleToken.sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

/**
  * @title SimpleToken
  * @dev Very simple ERC20 Token example, where all tokens are pre-assigned to the creator.
  * Note they can later distribute these tokens as they wish using `transfer` and other
  * `ERC20` functions.
  * Based on https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v2.5.1/contracts/examples/SimpleToken.sol
  */
contract SimpleToken is ERC20 {
    /**
      * @dev Constructor that gives msg.sender all of existing tokens.
      */
    constructor(string memory name, string memory symbol, uint256 initialSupply) ERC20(name, symbol) {
      _mint(msg.sender, initialSupply);

    }
}
```

### Deploy Token

Before you deploy the contract, you need to install the Metamask Browser Plugin (e.g. Brave Browser). On the left menu "Deploy & run transactions" select as environment `Injected Web3`.  Watch Metamask or the icon to connect it. Then select SimpleToken as contract and open the deploy dialog. Fill in name, symbol, and initial supply (itâ€™s 1337 with 18 zeros) and then transact. Metamask should open and then confirm the transaction. By the way the suggested gas fee is 0.02498218 ETH (at the moment $100).

Remix deploys the contract and if it is successful, you will have a token address (take a look at Deployed Contracts).

### Import Token

Open up Metamask and click on Import token (at the Assets tab on the bottom). Add the Token Contract Address and Metamask should already shows the Token Symbol:

![Metamask import token](/images/Metamask_import_token.png)

Now you have 1337 LARS tokens.

### Token Balance

The simple web3 example could be extended to get the balance for each account:

```javascript
const tokenAddress = '0x8173d2B99480495Daee702A521b1fD7D1191a21e';

accounts.forEach(async (account) => {
  const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(abiJson, tokenAddress);
  const tokenBalance = await contract.methods.balanceOf(account).call();

  console.log(account, tokenBalance);
})
```

The `abiJson` can be found at Remix at the Solidity compiler tab on the bottom. Just copy it and add it in the code. This is the result for my account:

```text
0x4ED8ad0F527C264978b1a6885Cd4C56eCb84070a 1337000000000000000000
```

## Summary

Now I have my own LARS token, a simple one, only on my local network and when I stop ganache-cli they are gone. Iâ€™m also not able to swap them â€” too simple.

If the Ethereum Gas price wouldnâ€™t be so stupid high, I would deploy it just for fun on the real Ethereum blockchain. In case you like this blog post, or want to support me, I have created an Ethereum address: `0xf3522df5621A7E3a25eA02966f1ae28B909A3d4b` â€¦ all ETH will be used for LARS tokens and therefore for Gas.
