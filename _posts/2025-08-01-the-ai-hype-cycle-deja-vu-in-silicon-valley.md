credit:  flux1.schnell - Depict a desolate urban landscape overtaken by nature. Cracked billboards once advertising “AI Breakthroughs” and “Next-Gen Innovation” now hang crooked, half-obscured by ivy and moss. A toppled server rack lies rusting in the street, cables tangled like vines. Broken screens flicker faintly with fragments of code. In the distance, a sleek glass tech headquarters stands abandoned, its logo faded and windows shattered. The sky is overcast, casting a cold, bluish haze over the scene. A sense of forgotten ambition and decayed hype permeates the air — the ruins of a once-glorified AI boom.

excerpt: The AI boom feels like déjà vu for anyone who's weathered past tech bubbles. While media headlines promise sentient machines and mass disruption, real-world adoption tells a slower, more grounded story. This article compares the current AI hype cycle to previous technology frenzies, critiques inflated narratives from a veteran's perspective, and highlights the quiet but meaningful progress happening beneath the surface. When the hype fades, what remains may be the true foundation of the future.

> write an article and take these points into account: <br/>• “Write an essay comparing the current AI hype cycle to previous technology bubbles.” <br/>• “Summarize the difference between AI media narratives and real-world AI adoption.” <br/>• “Use the style of a tech industry veteran to critique the AI bubble.” <br/>• “Explain how real technological progress continues even as hype collapses.”

This article is based on [A Hitchhiker's Guide to the AI Bubble](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hitchhikers-guide-ai-bubble-django-beatty-3semc/) by Django Beatty. I asked Dia (browser) to summarize it and suggest prompts for writing a similar article. This result was generated with Bing’s ChatGPT and is 100% AI-written — it’s an experiment. If you want to generate your own article, just use the prompt above. If you are interested in the original article, here are the differences:

## 🚀 Hype, Hope, and Hysteria: A Familiar Pattern

If you've been in tech long enough, you start to recognize the rhythm of a bubble. The AI hype cycle we're living through now feels eerily familiar—like the dot-com boom of the late '90s or the crypto craze of the 2010s. The pattern is predictable: a breakthrough moment (ChatGPT, in this case), followed by a gold rush of startups, breathless media coverage, inflated valuations, and eventually, a sobering correction.

Just as every company in 1999 suddenly needed a ".com" in its name, today every product is being rebranded as “AI-powered.” Investors are throwing money at anything with a transformer model and a pitch deck. But as with previous bubbles, the froth is obscuring the real signal.

## 📰 Media Narratives vs. Reality: The AI Mirage

The media loves a good story, and AI delivers in spades—sentient machines, job-stealing bots, and utopian productivity gains. But the reality on the ground is far more nuanced:

| **Media Narrative**                          | **Real-World Adoption**                          |
|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| AI will replace all human jobs               | Most AI tools augment rather than replace labor |
| AGI is just around the corner                | Narrow AI still dominates practical use cases   |
| Every company is “AI-first”                  | Most firms are still experimenting or piloting  |
| AI is universally transformative             | Impact varies widely by industry and geography  |

The disconnect between headlines and implementation is stark. Enterprises are cautiously integrating AI into workflows, often hitting roadblocks like data quality, regulatory concerns, and integration complexity. Meanwhile, the public is bombarded with stories of AI doing everything from writing novels to running companies.

## 🧓 A Veteran’s Take: Lessons from Past Bubbles

Having lived through the dot-com crash, the mobile app gold rush, and the crypto rollercoaster, I’ve learned that hype is a poor predictor of long-term value. The AI bubble has all the classic symptoms:

- **Overpromising**: Startups claiming to “revolutionize” industries with little more than a fine-tuned LLM.
- **Under-delivering**: Products that demo well but fail in real-world deployment.
- **Talent drain**: Engineers lured away from meaningful work to chase VC-funded moonshots.
- **Valuation inflation**: Companies with minimal revenue commanding billion-dollar valuations.

But here’s the twist: bubbles aren’t all bad. They attract talent, capital, and attention. They accelerate experimentation. And when the dust settles, the survivors often build the infrastructure for the next wave of innovation.

## 🔧 Progress Beneath the Hype

Even as the hype collapses—and it will—real technological progress continues. Quietly, foundational work is being done:

- **Model efficiency**: Researchers are making AI models faster, cheaper, and more energy-efficient.
- **Multimodal capabilities**: AI is learning to handle text, images, audio, and video in unified systems.
- **Enterprise integration**: Tools are being built to make AI usable in legacy systems and regulated industries.
- **Ethics and safety**: Serious efforts are underway to make AI more transparent, fair, and controllable.

These developments don’t make headlines, but they’re the bedrock of sustainable innovation. When the hype fades, what remains is the infrastructure, the talent, and the lessons learned.

## 🧭 Final Thoughts: Beyond the Bubble

AI is not a fad—it’s a foundational shift. But like every transformative technology, it must pass through the fire of inflated expectations and inevitable disillusionment. The key is to separate the noise from the signal, the spectacle from the substance.

So yes, we’re in a bubble. But bubbles burst. What matters is what’s left behind—and in AI’s case, that might just be the future.

## 📝 Summary

- The current AI hype cycle mirrors past tech bubbles like dot-com and crypto.
- Media narratives exaggerate AI’s capabilities and pace of adoption.
- Real-world AI integration is slower, more cautious, and industry-specific.
- Despite inflated valuations and overpromises, meaningful progress is happening behind the scenes.
- When the hype fades, the foundational work being done today will shape the next era of innovation.
