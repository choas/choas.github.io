> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. -- [Advent of Code: About](https://adventofcode.com/2019/about)

I heard about [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019) (AoC) for the first time this year through a tweet from [@Sygyzmundovych](https://twitter.com/Sygyzmundovych/status/1201635851958128645). The AoC 2019 ran already 5 days.  I sat down to catch up the first days and I managed this over the weekend. However, a cold came in between, so I only made it to the 9th day.

As programming language I used Python with Jupyter notebooks and _numpy_ and _pandas_. I have uploaded the result on GitHub: [choas/aoc2019](https://github.com/choas/aoc2019)

The AoC is initiated by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl) since 2015. This year the challenges are about a journey with a spacecraft ðŸš€ through universe. The challenges are fun and you even develop an own programming language. Since it is touring complete, the AoC challenges could also be solved with this language.

[anthonywritescode](https://github.com/anthonywritescode/aoc2019) uses different programming languages to solve the tasks, also __intcode__. He streams live how he proceeds with the individual challenges. I saw when he started with [Lua](https://www.lua.org/). It was interesting to see how he first installed Lua and learned the language before solving the challenge. Note: I think the idea to integrate Lua into iOS was influenced by this.

In 2020 I will start on the first day, and I also like the idea to use different programming languages.

__I ðŸ–¤ programming languages.__
