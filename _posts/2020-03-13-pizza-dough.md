> This recipe is dedicated to helping you make the best possible pizza dough for Neapolitan pizza. ‚Äî [Pizza Dough](https://github.com/hendricius/pizza-dough)

I found the [Pizza Dough](https://github.com/hendricius/pizza-dough) recipe or rather the instructions some time ago and now it is finally time to 'build' the dough. Somehow I like recipes that are described like a building instruction more interesting than regular recipes. Of course I have the book \<\>, and I should try to make much more from it ... and blog about it - but don't worry, this will not be a food blog.

## 24 hours before the first step ... 48 hours until the result

First of all I need the ingredients for the dough, for this there is a [calculator](https://pizza-calculator.the-bread-code.io/).

4x pizzas of 220g:

- flour 526.95g
- water 342.51g
- salt 10.54g
- dry yeast 0.26g (fresh yeast 0.79g)

Everything is at home, except the flour, which requires a lot of protein. I had no problem finding flour, which can be a problem üêπ these days.

## Day 1 ‚Äî 24 hours until pizza

Let‚Äôs start:

- Mix all the ingredients
- watch the video how to stretch and fold
- 0:30 first time stretch and fold
- 1:00 2nd stretch and fold
