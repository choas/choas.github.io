> RSS is a web feed that allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a standardized, computer-readable format. â€” [Wikipedia: RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS)

Do you use RSS feeds? I don't anymore. I look at my three news sites, maybe Reddit if I'm bored, and from time to time I read Twitter. When working from home I get the links directly. In the past, I got the message when I met someone and the note "I will send you the link" which came maybe two days later.

Anyway, I noticed that my RSS feed was only available locally, but not on the internet. The reason for this is that I had not included the [`jekyll-feed` plugin in the `_config.yml` file](https://github.com/choas/choas.github.io/commit/6b86d0404dae98fc024a86570f28ed94e5995f08).

## Summary

If I have a reader out ðŸ”­ there, you can also subscribe to the [RSS feed](https://www.larsgregori.de/feed.xml).
