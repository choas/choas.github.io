> Emoji are ideograms and smileys used in electronic messages and web pages. Emoji exist in various genres, including facial expressions, common objects, places and types of weather, and animals. -- [Wikipedia: Emoji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji)

I started writing my blog post with Emacs until I realized that Emacs does not support emojis 😱. Emacs - some people make fun 🤪 of it by saying it is an operating system - has no emojis support? That was the first surprise 😮 until I found out why:

__The Emacs developers deliberately disabled a feature that was working perfectly fine for MacOS users just because it is not available for free systems. What a daft decision. -- [GNU Emacs Removes Color Emoji Support on the Mac](http://ergoemacs.org/misc/emacs_macos_emoji.html)__

Emacs does not support emojis because Linux does not have support 🙈 for emojis?!? What kind of 🤯 logic is this??? __Goodbye Emacs__ - even if I could build 🏗 my own Emacs version that supports emojis.

Do you need a reason too?

- Your toaster 🍞 does not print emojis like a [Toasteroid](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/258723592/toasteroid-first-app-controlled-smart-image-toaste)?
- Your fridge 🧊 does not recognize emojis?
- Your washing 🧼 machine doesn't put emojis on your clothes?

It was a nice time, but now it's time to say 🤬.
