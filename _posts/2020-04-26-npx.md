> Running npx command name automatically finds the correct reference of the command inside the node\_modules folder of a project, without needing to know the exact path, and without requiring the package to be installed globally and in the user's path. ‚Äî [The npx Node.js Package Runner](https://nodejs.dev/the-npx-nodejs-package-runner)

Two weeks ago the first online Node.js Munich Meetup took place. During a presentation I saw _npx_ again and it reminded me that I had wanted to try it for a while.

Sometime in the past I had already seen it, but at that time I had no use for it and I forgot about it. Today I saw npx again and thought that I just need to have a closer look üßê at it.

## Running node tools and scripts

I don't like to install nodejs packages globally, because I don't know which node version will work and what dependencies they need, which are then globally installed. For this reason I have installed the global tools locally only. To run them I have called `./node_modules/.bin/mocha`. Another possibility is to put the `./node_modules/.bin` directory into the PATH variable, but only for the specific project. For this purpose [direnv](https://direnv.net/) is very suitable, because direnv automatically sets the environment variables as soon as you change into the directory.

## npx

npx automatically finds the correct reference of the command within the `node_modules` folder of a project. It is not necessary to know the exact path. Likewise, the package does not need to be global or in the user's path.

If you want to know more, have a look at the article [Introducing npx: an npm package runner](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b). It gives a wonderful overview.

## Summary

I finally looked at npx. Now I should not forget it. I also replaced the `./node_modules/.bin` calls of my [sap-leonardo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sap-leonardo) npm package with npx calls.
