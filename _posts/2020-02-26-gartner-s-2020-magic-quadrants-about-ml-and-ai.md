> Magic Quadrant is a series of market research reports published by IT consulting firm Gartner that rely on proprietary qualitative data analysis methods to demonstrate market trends, such as direction, maturity and participants. ‚Äî [Wikipedia: Magic Quadrant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Quadrant)

At the moment two Gartner Magic Quadrant reports about AI and Machine Learning are available:

- [Magic Quadrant for Data Science and Machine Learning Platforms](https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-1YCTPMUL&ct=200213) (11.02.2020) ![Magic Quadrant for Data Science and Machine Learning Platforms](/images/385005_0001.png)

- [Magic Quadrant for Cloud AI Developer Services](https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-1YGJKIVV&ct=200224) (24.02.2020) ![Magic Quadrant for Cloud AI Developer Services](/images/431332_0001.png)

When you look at both üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Magic Quadrants, you will notice the following:

- H2O.ai is in both in the Visionaries quadrant (see my two blog posts [1](/2019/12/22/h2o-ai-automl-model-in-java/), [2](/2019/12/23/h2o-automl-with-python-and-jupyter/))
- IBM, Microsoft and Google are in both
- Amazon is missing in the first and in the second leading

## Amazon is missing in one Magic Quadrant

The Forbes article [Gartner‚Äôs 2020 Magic Quadrant For Data Science And Machine Learning Platforms Has Many Surprises](https://www.forbes.com/sites/janakirammsv/2020/02/20/gartners-2020-magic-quadrant-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-platforms-has-many-surprises/#15dd2fbd3f55) found the reason why Amazon is missing in one Magic Quadrant:

- [Amazon SageMaker Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-sagemaker-studio-the-first-fully-integrated-development-environment-for-machine-learning/) and [Amazon SageMaker Autopilot](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/autopilot/) were "announced at re:Invent in December while Gartner‚Äôs cutoff was November"
- ‚Ä¶ and the first Magic Quandrant has also the note "As of November 2019".

## Summary

The Magic Quadrants are based on "proprietary qualitative data analysis", so you don‚Äôt need to believe it. But they give a nice overview about ML and AI.
