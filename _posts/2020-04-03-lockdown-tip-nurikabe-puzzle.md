> Nurikabe is a binary determination puzzle named for Nurikabe, an invisible wall in Japanese folklore that blocks roads and delays foot travel. â€” [Wikipedia: Nurikabe Puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurikabe_(puzzle))

The advantage of home office is that you can sort out old documents and magazine during a conference call that you have wanted to sort out for a long time. I have collected a lot of waste paper, from which the most important thing that exists at the moment can be made: toilet paper ðŸ§» - I'm joking.

In these documents I found a piece of paper on which I had printed a [Nurikabe puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurikabe_(puzzle)). The copyright is from 2007, I don't know if there was an online version back then, but there is one today: [puzzle-nurikabe.com](https://www.puzzle-nurikabe.com/)

The rules are simple and you can read them at Wikipedia:

- the numbers represent the number of white squares
- the black fields must be connected
- there must be no black 2x2 fields
